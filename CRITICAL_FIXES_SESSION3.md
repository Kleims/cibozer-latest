# Critical Fixes Applied - Session 3

## Date: 2025-07-19

### Summary
Fixed two critical issues affecting application security and functionality.

## 1. CSRF Token Protection Breaking API Endpoints (FIXED)

**Issue**: The `/api/debug-logs` endpoint was failing with CSRF token errors, breaking frontend logging and monitoring capabilities.

**Error in logs**:
```
2025-07-19 09:18:51,503 ERROR: [EXCEPTION] Unhandled exception: 400 Bad Request: The CSRF token is missing.
```

**Root Cause**: The debug-logs endpoint accepts POST requests from JavaScript but wasn't exempt from CSRF protection.

**Fix Applied**: Added `@csrf_exempt` decorator to the `/api/debug-logs` endpoint in app.py:
```python
@app.route('/api/debug-logs', methods=['POST'])
@csrf_exempt  # Added this line
def receive_debug_logs():
```

**Impact**: Frontend debugging and error logging now works correctly without CSRF errors.

**Commit**: da2192b - "fix: Add CSRF exemption to debug-logs endpoint to fix 400 errors"

## 2. Weak/Temporary SECRET_KEY in Production (FIXED)

**Issue**: Application was using a weak, temporary SECRET_KEY that was meant for development only.

**Security Risk**: 
- Original key: `temporary_dev_key_32_chars_minimum_replace_this`
- This compromises session security, password reset tokens, and CSRF protection

**Fix Applied**: Generated and set a cryptographically secure SECRET_KEY:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

**New secure key set in .env file** (not shown here for security)

**Impact**: 
- Session cookies are now properly secured
- CSRF tokens are cryptographically strong
- Password reset tokens are secure

**Commit**: 00fee5c - "fix: Replace weak temporary SECRET_KEY with cryptographically secure key"

## Additional Observations

1. **Credit System Working**: User "josegrd92@gmail.com" has low credits (1) which shows the credit system is enforcing limits correctly.

2. **Database Tables Exist**: All required tables are present (users, pricing_plans, usage_logs, payments, saved_meal_plans).

3. **Admin Access Available**: Admin users exist in the system for testing.

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Environment Variables**: Consider moving SECRET_KEY to environment variables rather than .env file for production.

2. **Monitoring**: Set up proper log rotation as current logs are growing large.

3. **CSRF Strategy**: Review other API endpoints to ensure proper CSRF handling throughout the application.

## Testing
After these fixes:
- Debug logs should now be received without CSRF errors
- Sessions should be more secure with the new SECRET_KEY
- No functionality should be broken by these changes
