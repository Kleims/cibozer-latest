TASK:
Fix the 23 failing tests.
1. Run pytest to see which tests are failing
2. Fix the actual issues (not just the tests)
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Do NOT create stub implementations

GROUND RULES (non-negotiable):
- Real fixes only. No duct tape.
- Test everything. Hope is not a strategy.
- Stay focused. This isn't a hackathon.
- Report facts. I can handle the truth.

Stop procrastinating. Start fixing. Go.
