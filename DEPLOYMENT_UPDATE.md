# Cibozer Deployment Update - Security & Payment Integration

## Overview of Changes

This update delivers critical security improvements and payment integration to enable monetization of the Cibozer SaaS platform.

### 1. Admin Security Fix (Critical)

**Issue**: Admin password was hardcoded as placeholder text in production
**Solution**: Created secure admin setup script that:
- Generates cryptographically secure passwords
- Updates both .env file and database
- Validates environment configuration
- Provides clear setup instructions

**Usage**:
```bash
python setup_admin.py
```

### 2. Stripe Payment Integration

**Features Added**:
- Complete payment processing module (`payments.py`)
- Support for Pro ($9.99/mo) and Premium ($19.99/mo) tiers
- Credit-based system for free users (3 credits/month)
- Graceful fallback when Stripe not configured (test mode)
- Webhook handling for subscription lifecycle
- Frontend checkout integration

**Configuration Required**:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=price_your_pro_price_id
STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID=price_your_premium_price_id
```

### 3. User Flow Improvements

- Updated credit checking to use new payment module
- Enhanced upgrade page with real Stripe checkout
- Added loading states and error handling
- Test mode for development without Stripe

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Environment Variables

```bash
# Generate new admin password
python setup_admin.py

# Add Stripe keys to .env (if available)
# Or leave defaults for test mode
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (if using Stripe)

```bash
pip install stripe==7.8.0
```

### 3. Database Migration

The app will auto-create new tables on startup, including:
- Payment tracking
- Subscription management
- Enhanced user fields

### 4. Test the Integration

```bash
# Start the app
python app.py

# Test flows:
1. Visit /admin/login with new credentials
2. Create a test user account
3. Try to generate >3 meal plans (should prompt upgrade)
4. Visit /auth/upgrade and test checkout
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Never commit .env file** with real credentials
2. **Use environment variables** in production for all secrets
3. **Enable HTTPS** for payment processing
4. **Configure Stripe webhooks** with proper endpoint URL
5. **Monitor failed login attempts** via logs

## Revenue Model

- **Free Tier**: 3 meal plans/month, basic features
- **Pro Tier**: $9.99/mo, unlimited plans, PDF export, 7-day planning
- **Premium Tier**: $19.99/mo, everything + API access, family planning

## Monitoring

Check these endpoints:
- `/health` - System health check
- `/metrics` - Usage statistics
- `/admin/analytics` - Revenue dashboard (admin only)

## Known Issues Resolved

1. ✅ Admin security vulnerability fixed
2. ✅ Payment processing integrated
3. ✅ Credit system properly enforced
4. ⚠️ Log rotation on Windows (non-critical)

## Next Steps

1. Configure production Stripe account
2. Set up Stripe webhook endpoint
3. Enable subscription analytics
4. Add email notifications for upgrades/downgrades
5. Implement usage-based billing for API access

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check logs in `/logs/cibozer.log`
- Review payment logs for transaction issues
- Use test mode for development
