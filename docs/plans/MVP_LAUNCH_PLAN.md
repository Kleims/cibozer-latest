## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Scaling issues
- **Mitigation**: Load test early, use CDN for videos

### Market Risks
- **Risk**: Low retention (70% industry average churn)
- **Mitigation**: Implement all 4 retention features from BOK

### Financial Risks
- **Risk**: High CAC
- **Mitigation**: Focus on organic/content marketing first

### Competitive Risks
- **Risk**: Feature copying
- **Mitigation**: Fast iteration, focus on video differentiator

## Success Criteria
1. **Technical**: 0 critical bugs, <2s load time, 99.9% uptime
2. **User**: 30% day-30 retention (3x industry average)
3. **Business**: $500 MRR, LTV:CAC > 3:1
4. **Strategic**: Clear path to $5K MRR within 6 months

## Next Steps
1. Run `python launch_automation.py` to start Phase 1
2. Review daily metrics in `metrics_dashboard.py`
3. Weekly progress reviews every Monday
4. Pivot decisions based on data, not assumptions
