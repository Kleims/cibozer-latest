## Launch a Working Meal Planning App That People Can Actually Use

- Don't encounter any breaking bugs

**Timeline: 30 days from today**

## 🎯 **The Only KPIs That Matter Right Now**

1. **Works?** (Yes/No)
2. **10 Users?** (Number)
3. **They came back?** (Yes/No)
4. **Still running?** (Yes/No)

Everything else is vanity metrics for MVP.

Every day ask:
- [ ] Is the site up?
- [ ] Did anyone sign up?
- [ ] Did anyone report a bug?
- [ ] What's the #1 problem right now?
- [ ] What can I fix in 2 hours?

## 🏁 **Definition of MVP Done**

The MVP is DONE when:

1. **Sarah** (a real person who likes meal planning) can:
   - Sign up without help
   - Create a meal plan for her diet
   - Save it for later
   - Come back tomorrow and see it
   - Download or share it somehow
   - Not encounter any errors
   - Do all this on her phone

2. **9 other people like Sarah** have done the same

3. **The app has been up for 48 hours** without crashing

4. **You have a list** of what the 10 users want next

That's it. That's MVP success.

---

## 💭 **Reality Check**

**What we're building:** A simple web app that generates meal plans and saves them.

**What we're NOT building:** The next unicorn startup.

**Success looks like:** 10 people saying "Hey, this is useful!"

**Failure looks like:** Spending 6 months adding features before anyone uses it.

**Remember:** Facebook started as a simple directory. Twitter was just status updates. Instagram was just photo filters. 

**Start simple. Get users. Then grow.**

---

## 📝 **Next Action (Right Now)**

1. Run the tests: `python -m pytest tests/`
2. Count how many fail
3. Fix the first one
4. Repeat

Or if that's too much:

1. Try to sign up as a new user
2. Try to create a meal plan
3. Fix the first thing that breaks
4. Repeat

**The goal isn't perfection. It's 10 real users using a thing that works.**
