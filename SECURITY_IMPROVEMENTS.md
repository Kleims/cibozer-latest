# Security Improvements

## Content Security Policy (CSP) Enhancement

The current CSP uses 'unsafe-inline' for scripts and styles, which weakens security. To improve this:

### Recommended Approach:
1. Move all inline scripts to external files
2. Use nonces or hashes for necessary inline scripts
3. Move inline styles to CSS files

### Implementation Steps:
1. Audit all templates for inline scripts/styles
2. Extract JavaScript to static/js files
3. Extract styles to static/css files
4. Update CSP to remove 'unsafe-inline'

### Temporary Mitigation:
Until inline scripts can be refactored, the current CSP provides reasonable protection by:
- Restricting script sources to self and trusted CDNs
- Blocking eval() and similar functions
- Preventing XSS from untrusted sources

## Exception Handling Improvements Completed:
- ✅ Replaced broad `except Exception` with specific exceptions in meal_optimizer.py
- ✅ Added proper error logging with context
- ✅ Re-enabled nutrition validation that was disabled for debugging

## Next Security Steps:
1. Implement request validation middleware
2. Add API rate limiting per user
3. Enhance session security
4. Add CORS configuration
5. Implement proper secrets management
