# APEX Tracking System Updates

## Summary of Changes

I've updated the APEX system to ensure all tracking files are properly maintained during iterations:

### 1. **Enhanced apex_complete.sh**
- **METRICS.md** now includes:
  - Comprehensive change summaries
  - Proper test/coverage delta calculations
  - Duration tracking
  - Unresolved issue counts
  
- **FAILED_ATTEMPTS.md** automatically logs:
  - Any iteration with test failures
  - Critical failures get HIGH priority
  - Test regressions are tracked
  
- **FIXES.log** records:
  - Successful fixes with descriptions
  - Modified files list
  - Baseline updates

- **BASELINES.md** updates:
  - Coverage improvements
  - Test count increases
  - LOC tracking
  - Visual confirmation of updates

### 2. **Enhanced apex.sh**
- Automatic initialization of empty tracking files
- Detection and resolution of PROJECT_CONTEXT.md merge conflicts
- Verification of tracking file state before starting
- Proper headers for all tracking files

### 3. **New Helper Scripts**
- `scripts/apex_track.sh` - Bash functions for tracking updates
- `scripts/update_apex_tracking.py` - Python utilities for metrics
- `scripts/apex_verify_tracking.sh` - Verification tool

### 4. **What Gets Tracked Now**

#### On Every Iteration:
- **METRICS.md** - Full iteration metrics with changes summary
- **BASELINES.md** - Updated performance baselines
- **LOC tracking** - Lines of code changes

#### On Failures:
- **FAILED_ATTEMPTS.md** - Issue description and priority
- Test regression details
- Critical failure tracking

#### On Success:
- **FIXES.log** - What was fixed and how
- Files modified
- Performance improvements

#### Every 10 Iterations:
- Pattern analysis in METRICS.md
- Success rate by focus area
- Recurring issues summary

### 5. **Merge Conflict Handling**
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md conflicts are auto-resolved
- v4.1 architectural documentation is preserved
- Test commands are maintained at the top

## Usage

The tracking system now works automatically:

1. Run `apex.sh` to start an iteration
2. Make changes during the iteration
3. Run `apex_complete.sh` to finish

All tracking files will be updated appropriately based on the iteration results.

To verify the tracking system status:
```bash
bash scripts/apex_verify_tracking.sh
```

This ensures complete visibility into the evolution process and maintains a comprehensive history of all changes, successes, and failures.
