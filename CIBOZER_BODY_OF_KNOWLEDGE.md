## Advanced Nutrition Science

### Protein Science & Requirements

**Evidence-Based Protein Guidelines**:
- **RDA**: 0.8g/kg for sedentary adults (minimum for nitrogen balance)
- **Athletes**: 1.2-1.8g/kg depending on training intensity
- **Older Adults**: 1.7-1.8g/kg to prevent sarcopenia
- **Upper Safe Limit**: 2.8g/kg shows no adverse kidney effects in athletes

**Protein Synthesis Optimization**:
- 0.25g/kg per meal for maximal muscle protein synthesis
- Pre-sleep casein (30-40g) increases overnight MPS
- Leucine threshold: 2.5-3g per meal for anabolic signaling

### Metabolic Health & Weight Management

**Intermittent Fasting Benefits (2024 Research)**:
- **Weight Loss**: 5.5-6.5kg at 6 months (similar to continuous restriction)
- **Insulin Sensitivity**: -7.46 pmol/L fasting insulin reduction
- **HOMA-IR**: -0.14 improvement
- **Visceral Fat**: Preferential reduction over subcutaneous fat

**Alternate Day Fasting (ADF)**: Most effective for body weight, BMI, waist circumference
**Time-Restricted Eating (TRE)**: Superior for fasting glucose reduction
**Metabolic Switch**: Glucose → Ketones during fasting enhances cellular repair

### Sports Nutrition & Performance

**Pre-Workout (3 hours before)**:
- Carbs: Maximize glycogen for high-intensity exercise
- Protein: Enhance muscle protein synthesis
- Fat: Fuel for longer duration activities

**Post-Workout Anabolic Window (30min-2hrs)**:
- Carbs: 0.8g/kg within 4 hours
- Protein: 0.2-0.4g/kg for recovery
- CHO:PRO ratio 3-4:1 for endurance athletes

**Endurance Athletes**:
- Daily carbs: 8-12g/kg body weight
- During exercise: 30-60g CHO/hour
- Protein during endurance: 0.25g/kg/hour

**Recovery Foods**:
- Tart cherry juice: Reduces oxidative stress
- Omega-3s: Decrease inflammation, support joint health
- Turmeric: Anti-inflammatory properties

### Gut Health & Microbiome

**2024 Microbiome Insights**:
- **Fiber Diversity**: Different bacteria prefer different plant fibers
- **Fermented Foods**: 5 servings/day increases diversity, reduces inflammation
- **SCFA Production**: Lower colon pH limits harmful bacteria growth

**Prebiotic Foods**:
- Asparagus (highest prebiotic content)
- Artichokes, chicory root, leeks
- Bananas, oatmeal, beans

**Probiotic Sources**:
- Kefir, yogurt (live cultures)
- Kimchi, sauerkraut, miso
- Tempeh, kombucha

**Synbiotic Approach**: Combine prebiotics + probiotics for optimal benefit

### Chrononutrition & Meal Timing

**Circadian Optimization**:
- **Morning Meals**: Higher diet-induced thermogenesis
- **Evening Restriction**: Reduced metabolic efficiency
- **TRE Benefits**: 3% weight loss, improved metabolic markers without calorie restriction

**Meal Distribution**:
- Larger breakfast, smaller dinner optimizes metabolism
- 12+ hour overnight fast aligns with circadian rhythms
- Late eating (after 8pm) associated with weight gain

**Chronotype Considerations**:
- Early birds: Earlier meal timing optimal
- Night owls: Later feeding window acceptable
- Genetic clock variations affect ideal timing

### Special Population Requirements

**Pregnancy**:
- Protein: 1.1g/kg (up from 0.8g/kg)
- Folate: 400mcg/day (neural tube defects prevention)
- Iron: 30mg/day (doubled requirement)
- Calcium: 1000mg/day
- Extra calories: +340 (2nd trimester), +450 (3rd trimester)

**Elderly (65+)**:
- Protein: 1.2-1.5g/kg (sarcopenia prevention)
- Vitamin D: 800-1000 IU/day
- B12: Increased needs due to absorption issues
- Hydration: Decreased thirst sensation requires attention

**Young Athletes**:
- Fat: 20-35% total energy (growth support)
- Avoid supplements, focus whole foods
- Hydration critical due to higher sweat rates
- Energy availability: Prevent RED-S

**Children & Adolescents**:
- Fat: 30-35% (ages 2-3), 25-35% (ages 4-18)
- Higher BMR requires increased nutrients
- Growth spurts at 15-16 need extra calories
- Focus on nutrient density over restriction

### Emerging Nutrition Science

**Low-Carb Metabolic Benefits**:
- Enhanced fat oxidation independent of weight loss
- Improved triglycerides, HDL-C, small LDL particles
- Fuel shift: Glucose/fatty acids → Fatty acids/ketones

**Micronutrient Adequacy**:
- Well-constructed low-carb diets provide sufficient micronutrients
- Quality matters more than macronutrient distribution
- Flexibility in ratios while meeting essential needs
