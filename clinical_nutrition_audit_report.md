**Clinical Issues:**
- ❌ **No net carb calculation** - System doesn't subtract fiber from total carbs
- ❌ **Missing ketone monitoring guidance**
- ❌ **No electrolyte supplementation recommendations**
- ⚠️ **Protein percentage too high** - Clinical keto typically 15-20% protein
- ❌ **No MCT oil or exogenous ketone considerations**

**Clinical Risk:** MODERATE - Incorrect net carb calculations could prevent ketosis

## Macro Calculation Accuracy

### Strengths:
- ✅ Proper caloric values (4-4-9 for protein-carbs-fat)
- ✅ Percentage-based macro distribution
- ✅ Validation of extreme values
- ✅ Scaling algorithms maintain ratios

### Critical Gaps:
- ❌ **No net carb calculations** (total carbs - fiber)
- ❌ **No sugar alcohol considerations**
- ❌ **Missing energy from alcohol**
- ❌ **No distinction between sugar types**
- ❌ **No saturated vs unsaturated fat tracking**

---

## Micronutrient Considerations

### Current State:
- ❌ **ZERO micronutrient tracking in ingredient database**
- ❌ **No RDI/DRI compliance checking**
- ❌ **No nutrient density calculations**
- ❌ **No bioavailability factors**

### Critical Missing Nutrients:
1. **Vitamins:** B12, D, K, Folate, B6, Thiamine
2. **Minerals:** Iron, Calcium, Zinc, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium
3. **Other:** Omega-3 fatty acids, Fiber, Cholesterol

### Clinical Impact:
- Cannot ensure nutritional adequacy
- Risk of hidden deficiencies
- No therapeutic diet validation

---

## Medical Safety Protocols

### Current Implementation:
- Basic medical condition profiles (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)
- Ingredient avoidance lists
- Macro adjustments per condition

### Critical Safety Gaps:

1. **Drug-Nutrient Interactions:** ❌ NOT ADDRESSED
   - Warfarin + Vitamin K
   - MAOIs + Tyramine
   - Statins + Grapefruit

2. **Allergen Management:** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
   - Basic allergen mapping exists
   - No cross-contamination warnings
   - No severity levels (intolerance vs allergy)

3. **Portion Control:** ⚠️ BASIC
   - Min/max ingredient amounts
   - No body weight calculations
   - No activity level adjustments

4. **Hydration:** ❌ NOT TRACKED
   - Critical for kidney disease, elderly
   - No fluid recommendations

## Final Clinical Assessment

The Cibozer meal optimizer shows promise but falls significantly short of clinical nutrition standards. While the macro-based approach provides basic dietary pattern support, the absence of micronutrient tracking and comprehensive safety protocols makes it unsuitable for therapeutic use.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Add fiber to all ingredient entries
2. Implement net carb calculations
3. Add minimum micronutrient set (B12, D, Iron, Calcium)
4. Enhance allergen warnings
5. Add clinical disclaimers

**Recommendation:** System requires substantial upgrades before clinical deployment. Current state suitable only for general meal planning with appropriate disclaimers and professional oversight recommendations.
