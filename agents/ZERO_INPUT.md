# ZERO INPUT COMMANDS

## You literally don't need to say anything:

### Work on one task:
```bash
/run python agents/work.py
```

### Work all day (multiple tasks):
```bash
/run python agents/work.py all
```

## That's it. No input needed.

## What it does:

1. **Analyzes your entire project**
2. **Finds what needs to be done**
3. **Prioritizes by importance**
4. **Deploys the right agents**
5. **Completes the task**
6. **Moves to the next task**

## It automatically finds and fixes:

- 🐛 Bugs (from TODO/FIXME comments)
- 🔒 Security issues
- ⚡ Performance problems
- 📝 Missing documentation
- ✨ Missing features
- 🧪 Failing tests
- 🚀 Deployment issues
- 🎨 Code quality problems

## Priority System:

1. **CRITICAL** - Security issues, failing tests
2. **HIGH** - Bugs, deployment issues
3. **MEDIUM** - Features, performance
4. **LOW** - Documentation, code quality

## You literally just run:
```bash
/run python agents/work.py
```

And it handles EVERYTHING.
