# THE ONLY COMMAND YOU NEED

## Just One Command:

```bash
/run python agents/do.py "what you want"
```

## That's it. Nothing else.

### Examples:

```bash
/run python agents/do.py "fix the login bug"
```
Automatically uses Developer agent to fix it

```bash
/run python agents/do.py "add user notifications feature"
```
Automatically runs full workflow: PM → Developer → DevOps

```bash
/run python agents/do.py "deploy to production"
```
Automatically handles deployment workflow

```bash
/run python agents/do.py
```
No task? It checks for pending work and continues automatically

## How It Works:

1. **You say what you want**
2. **It figures out which agents to use**
3. **It runs the complete workflow**
4. **It only bothers you if it gets stuck**

## The System Automatically:
- ✅ Analyzes your request
- ✅ Determines if it needs one agent or multiple
- ✅ Runs the right workflow (feature, bugfix, deployment, etc.)
- ✅ Tracks everything in session history
- ✅ Updates project context
- ✅ Continues pending work

## You Don't Need To:
- ❌ Choose which agent
- ❌ Define workflows
- ❌ Manage sessions
- ❌ Track tasks
- ❌ Remember commands

## Just tell it what you want. That's it.
