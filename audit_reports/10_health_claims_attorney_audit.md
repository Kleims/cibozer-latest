## Conclusion and Recommendations

1. **Retain qualified health law counsel immediately**
2. **Implement comprehensive disclaimer system**
3. **Remove all unsubstantiated health claims**
4. **Create compliant terms of service and privacy policy**
5. **Establish professional advisory oversight**

### LEGAL VIABILITY ASSESSMENT:
The application concept is legally viable with proper compliance implementation, but requires significant investment in legal infrastructure and ongoing professional oversight.

**Estimated Time to Compliance:** 6-12 months  
**Investment Required:** $60,000 - $122,000 (first year)  
**Ongoing Annual Costs:** $35,000 - $75,000  

This audit represents a preliminary legal assessment and does not constitute legal advice. Professional legal counsel should be retained immediately for implementation of recommended changes and ongoing compliance monitoring.
